# dctcov core — plugin contract (v1, working name)

Status: COMMITTED for this engine generation (libdct_hc.so). The packaging
repo may wrap these flat symbols in its own vtable; the symbols below are the
stable surface.

## What the framework is

A GPU engine for combinatorial covering-type problems whose move gains and
losses can be computed for ALL candidate positions at once by a **separable
transform over a finite product space** X = prod_j Z_{ax_j} (heterogeneous
axis sizes allowed, n <= 16 axes, space <= 2^40).

Problems in scope: covering codes (q-ary and mixed-radix Hamming),
dominating sets on torus grids / Hamming graphs, packing and multi-cover
variants (any problem where "u covers x" is a shift-invariant product
predicate per axis).

Three layers:

1. **STATE CORE** (`dctcore_core.cuh`, problem-blind)
   - dense int32 layer planes A_0..A_L and a uint16 multiplicity plane `cnt`
     over X, each placeable in HBM (`cudaMalloc`), LPDDR via ATS
     (`malloc` — GH200 cache-coherent C2C), or managed memory with
     preferred-location CPU: memory modes 0/1/2 per array group;
   - support-set walks: exact incremental `cnt` +/- updates and
     `cnt==target` gathers over a move's coverage set, given as a packed
     shift-pattern table (formats below), with split-block launch geometry;
   - owner plane + owner-trick losspass (mark tags owner, loss = one scan);
   - reductions (count_eq, max, histogram) and threshold extraction with
     32- and 64-bit indices.

2. **PROBLEM PLUGIN** (one .cuh + a host-side table builder)
   Supplies exactly two things:
   a) an **axis-pass driver** `int <name>_axes(int out_mode, int blocks,
      int threads)` that turns A_0 = indicator(S) into the coverage field
      via n separable per-axis passes (out_mode semantics below);
   b) a **support-table builder** (host side, Python is fine): the list of
      coordinate-shift patterns enumerating one move's coverage set.
   Registration: a `PROB_*` id, an arm in `dct_init3` validation
   (axis-size/R bounds, number of layer planes), an arm in `dct_transform`.

3. **SEARCH CORE** (`gpuchain.py Engine` — exact lazy greedy, LNS
   ruin-and-recreate, peel; `siege.py` — notch ladder, verification gate).
   Problem-blind: talks to the engine only through the oracle interface
   below. `Engine(..., problem=, axes=)` selects the plugin.

## The oracle interface (what search sees)

- `recount(S)`        -> cnt(x) = # elements of S covering x, for all x
- `gain_map()`        -> A0(x) = # currently-uncovered words a move at x
                          would cover (from S = [cnt==0])
- `loss_map()`        -> A0(x) = private coverage of a move at x
                          (from S = [cnt==1])
- `ball_update(w,+-1)`-> exact incremental cnt update for placed/removed w
- `ball_gather(w,t)`  -> exact # of words with cnt==t in w's coverage set
- `count_eq(t)`, `map_max()`, `map_hist()`, `map_extract(thr)`,
  `map_read_at(idx)`, `read_cnt()`
- optional: `loss_owner(S)` (owner-trick), `enable_tbl2()/use_fmt(f)`

Submodularity of coverage gain is what makes the lazy greedy exact; any
plugin whose coverage predicate is a fixed-shape neighborhood inherits it.

## C ABI (flat symbols, singleton context)

Decisions (2026-08-22, GPU-engine agent):
- **Singleton, not handles.** One cell per process is the operating model
  (planes are 10s-100s of GB). `void *ctx` first-arg is reserved for a
  future v2; do not emulate it.
- **Flat `dct_*` symbols**, int return codes (0 = ok, negative = error;
  -100-e = CUDA error e, message on stderr). No last-error string in v1.
- **Caller-allocated outputs** everywhere.
- **Typed init args**, no string blobs: the host-side per-plugin Python
  builds the support table and passes it in.

int  dct_init3(int problem, int n, const int *ax, int R,
               const uint64_t *ballpat, long long balllen, int extract_cap,
               long long *bytes, int layers_mode, int cnt_mode,
               int use_owner);
int  dct_init2(q, n, R, ...)                  // Hamming, homogeneous (legacy)

     // init_mode: 0 = solution multiset (set_code), 1 = [cnt==0], 2 = [cnt==1]

long long dct_count_eq(int target);
int  dct_map_max(int32_t *out);
int  dct_map_hist(int nbins, int32_t vmax, int32_t *out);

```

REQUIRED for any plugin: init3/free, set_code, transform (all three
init_modes), ball_update/gather, count_eq, map_max/extract(64)/read_at,
read_cnt.  OPTIONAL (feature-test via symbol presence / rc): loss_owner,
set_tbl2/use_fmt, map_hist, host_bytes.

## Support-table formats (state core walks both)

- v1 (`ballpat`): one uint64 per pattern; byte k = `pos<<4 | delta`,
  delta in 1..ax_pos-1 (circular shift), zero byte terminates; <= 8 bytes
  per pattern; entry 0 = empty pattern (the center itself).
- ox (`mask`,`offs`): uint16 position mask + uint64 with delta nibble at
  4*pos.  Same enumeration, any order.
Both formats therefore require ax_j <= 16, and the *pattern weight* (number
of changed positions) <= 8. Hamming balls have weight <= R; torus Chebyshev
balls have weight <= n, hence n <= 8 for plugin 2.

## Existing plugins

| id | name | axes | layers | transform |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `hamming` | 2..10, mixed ok | R+1 (R<=6) | distance-count DP: newA_d[a] = A_d[a] + T_{d-1} - A_{d-1}[a] per fiber |
| 1 | `torus_linf` | 3..16, 2R+1<=ax_j | 1 | circular window sum: newA[a] = sum_{|e|<=R} A[(a+e) mod ax_j] |

Both verified exhaustively against CPU brute force (bench_h2h_hc.py, all
gates PASS 2026-08-22); torus additionally re-derived the known optimum
(9-vertex domination of the 9x9 king torus) through the untouched search
core.

## Memory-placement policy (dctlib auto)

If all planes fit in `GPUDCT_HBM_BUDGET` (default 80 GB): everything HBM.
Else: layer planes -> LPDDR (mode 1, plain malloc + CPU first-touch; the
transforms stream them sequentially over C2C), `cnt` stays HBM while
2*|X| <= 40 GB (the random-access ball walks live there).  Rationale and
measured numbers: SIEGE.md 2026-08-22 entries.
